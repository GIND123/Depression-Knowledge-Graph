However, people in power sometimes misuse this form of censorship to obstruct the democratic right of freedom of speech. Therefore, it is imperative that research should take a positive reinforcement approach towards online content that is encouraging, positive and supportive contents. Until now, most studies have focused on solving this problem of negativity in the English language, though the problem is much more than just harmful content. Furthermore, it is multilingual as well. Thus, we have constructed a Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (HopeEDI) containing user-generated comments from the social media platform YouTube with 28,451, 20,198 and 10,705 comments in English, Tamil and Malayalam, respectively, manually labelled as containing hope speech or not. To our knowledge, this is the first research of its kind to annotate hope speech for equality, diversity and inclusion in a multilingual setting. We determined that the inter-annotator agreement of our dataset using Krippendorff{'}s alpha. Further, we created several baselines to benchmark the resulting dataset and the results have been expressed using precision, recall and F1-score. The dataset is publicly available for the research community. We hope that this resource will spur further research on encouraging inclusive and responsive speech that reinforces positiveness."

Overall the dataset consists of 4786 Tamil-English comments with 6202 annotated spans and 1097 Kannada-English comments with 1641 annotated spans, each annotated by two different annotators. We further present some of our baseline experimental results on the developed dataset, thereby eliciting research in under-resourced languages, leading to an essential step towards semi-automated content moderation in Dravidian languages.

abstract="Self-supervised learning (SSL) representations derived from multilingual speech using transformers have significantly improved the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks in low-resource languages. This study focuses on the development of an ASR system for the Malayalam language using pretrained SSL representations and enhance its performance with the inclusion of a statistical n-gram language model. A language model enhances speech recognition by improving contextual accuracy by guiding the decoding process with linguistic probabilities and reducing transcription errors. Our findings indicate that the language model augmentation reduces the word error rate by 12.5{\%} on in-domain test data and 5.9{\%} on out-of-domain test data. The datasets used are diverse, encompassing a variety of speakers, speech domains, and recording environments. Our results underscore the critical role of augmenting pre-trained speech representations with language models in developing ASR systems for languages with limited speech resources. The model is made openly available on HuggingFace for reproducibility and adaptation to similar languages.",
